# image-captcha-solver
A captcha solver for an old mmorpg game.

- Tesseract OCR must be installed in the project directory for the code to work.

- The reason for using the driver is to prevent the game from detecting mouse clicks. 
You can check the following github repo for information about the virtual keyboard-mouse driver used.
